# Visited-Places

# Places You’ve Been

## Project Description
Places You’ve Been is a JavaScript application that allows users to keep track of places they have visited. Each place is stored as an object with details such as location, landmarks, best time of year, and notes.

This project focuses on using constructors, prototypes, and test-driven development (TDD) to build business logic before adding a user interface.

## Business Logic

### Constructors
- `Place` – creates a place object
- `PlacesList` – stores and manages multiple places

### Prototypes
- `Place.prototype.summary()`
- `PlacesList.prototype.addPlace()`
- `PlacesList.prototype.findPlace()`
- `PlacesList.prototype.assignId()`
